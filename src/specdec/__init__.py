"""
Speculative Decoding Module

This module implements speculative decoding techniques to accelerate LLM inference
by predicting multiple tokens in parallel and verifying them efficiently.

Components:
- Draft model implementation
- Token prediction algorithms
- Verification and acceptance mechanisms
- Parallel token generation
- Performance optimization strategies
- Integration with main inference pipeline
